### 🔭 My Core Focus

<!-- Review this section -->
My work revolves around the full lifecycle of machine learning models, from architectural design to deployment and optimization. I'm particularly passionate about:

*   **Efficient Model Architectures:** I am currently working pn increasing the efficiency of Hypencoder models (retrieval models) by reducing the amount of training they require and reducing the size of the model using multi-objective optimization techniques. So far, I have managed to reduce the training duration by 7 times and reduce the computational complexity of the model by 9 times with results comparable to other SOTA retrieval model

*   **Production-Ready AI Systems:** I have engineering and deployed end-to-end ML solutions, for HVAC optimization and scientific information extraction. Most recently I have built and deployed **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for a fintech startup.

<!-- Fix this statement up -->
*   **MLOps & LLMOps:** My interest in AI and machine learning goes beyond model creation and testing into deploying and maintaining models in production. Therefore, I have an interest in the latest MLOps trends and practices to further increase the widespread use of AI.

* **Agentic AI:** Combing the previous three interests has naturally led me to building AI agents.
